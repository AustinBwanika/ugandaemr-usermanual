# Reporting 
The reporting functionality helps users to extract information in pre-built and custom reports to meet reporting needs for managing facility operations, meeting MoH and support other programatic work.

The reports are generated in the following ways:

1. [BIRT Reports](reporting_birt.md) for facility level and some MoH HMIS reports 
2. [Cohort Builder](reporting_cohort_builder.md) for custom data extraction in Excel for more detailed analysis
3. [UgandaEMR Reports](ugandaemr_reports.md) being developed to replace BIRT and provide a starting point for commonly used cohort builder report exports
