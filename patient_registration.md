### Common Errors 
#### User is not a provider
![User Not Provider Error](images/logged_in_user_not_provider.png)

### Solution:
The above means your User Account does not have privileges to provide care to a patient. You therefore have to add Provider role to the user account as [indicated herein](making_an_existing_user_a_provider.md) .
